Changes
=======

0.5.0
----------------
New features:
- Edited docstrings in:
    core.py
    utils.py
    functions.py
    plotting.py
    routing.py
    supercore.py
    anchors.py
    geometries.py
- Added 'colors' attribute to the Base class.
- Added method "change_color" to the Base class.
- Added label functionality to the "plot" method.
- Removed the need for a plot_config in the "quickplot" method. 
- Added small type checks for several methods and functions to ensure input validity.

0.4.4
----------------
New features:
- Added functions in utils.py: 
    oriented_angle                  Calculate the oriented angle
    find_nearest_point_index        Finds the index of the closest point in a Shapely polygon to a given point.
    round_polygon_corner            Rounds one corner of a Shapely polygon.
    replace_closest_polygon         Replaces the closest polygon in a MultiPolygon with a new polygon.
    round_corner                    Rounds the corner of the closest polygon in a MultiPolygon around a given points
- Added method "round_corner" to the Superstructure class.

Deprecated:
- round_sharp_corners in Superstructure is deprecated. Use round_corner instead.


0.4.3
----------------

New features:
- Added new class 'ContunousLineBuilder' which allows to create a continuous path/line and create buffered polygons along.
- Added additional RouteConfig and ObjsAlongConfig dataclasses to store the configuration for ContunousLineBuilder.


0.4.2
----------------

New features:

- Added 'show_line_idx' option to the 'quickplot' method to display line numbers of the polygon boundary.
- Added .svg file reader class Reader_SVG. Reads only into single layer L1.
- Added "mirror" function into util.py.
- Added CornerCutterPolygon and CornerRounder into geometries.py.
- Added heliumsurface.py which allows to create 2D meshes and calculate surface displacement of the liquid helium.
    formed in the microchannel structures using 2DFreeFEM.
- Added FEM extraction option of the coupling constants along calculated helium surface displacement.
- Added curved_surface.ipynb into examples demonstaring how to calculate surface displacement and integrate with FreeFEM.
- Small bug and fixes.

Improvements:

- Improved "add_along_skeletone" method in Superstructure class:
    "endpoints" arg can take (1,0) and (0,1) as arguments to add points at the beginning and end of the skeleton.

Notes:

- In order to run 2D fem from jupyter notebook, please install https://github.com/neoh54/pyFreeFem (forked package 
    from https://github.com/odevauchelle/pyFreeFem).
- The heliumsurface.py is still under development and may have some bugs. Please report any issues.
- Reader_SVG requires svgpathtools package to be installed. Please install it using 'pip install svgpathtools'.
